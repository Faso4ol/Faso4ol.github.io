            <p>Pommes Frites isn't an ordinary shop, but a specialty shop serving authentic Belgian fries, or as the Belgians call them, "pommes frites." You won't find many seats here, but you will find the tastiest treat in town. Pommes Frites means premium fresh fried potatoes, crunchy on the outside, and soft inside: self-indulgent and pleasurable.<br><br>The atmosphere is intimate and warm, the packaging and signage unique. Pommes Frites isn't only selling affordable food, but excitement and an experience, too. There is no fancy skill involved, but there is a trick. The potatoes are fried twice. The first time they are cooked through. The second time provides a golden color and makes them deliciously crisp.</p>
